# Inspiration
List of places I've looked at for inspiration.

## Astro Tutorial
Astro's tutorial is pretty great. You can find it [here](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/). It's pretty great! Initial commits pulled heavily from this.

## Astro Themes
Astro maintains a list of themes submitted by the community. I initially considered using one of these as a starter, but ended up using an empty Astro template instead.
- I could see how everything slots together
- I could find a page structure that makes sense for me
- I didn't want to have to update someone else's layout to newer Astro versions.

That said, I did look at a few themes for ideas, including:

| Name | Author | Source |
